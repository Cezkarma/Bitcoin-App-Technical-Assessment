# Bitcoin-App-Technical-Assessment
This is the Git repository used for the Bitcoin App technical assessment from Flash Group.

How to run:
- Clone the repository,
- Open the app in Xcode with the Bitcoin-App.xcodeproj file,
- Choose which device/simulator you want to run the app on,
- Click the 'Play' button, or click 'cmd + R'

Please watch the video titled "BitcoinAppShowcase.mov" to see the breakdown of my thought process when starting the app, as well as the implementation of my solution.

After watching that, please watch "WatchAfterMainVideo.mov" where I correct a mistake with the test cases from the first video.

In both cases, please excuse my rambling, I'm so not a public speaker LOL.


I believe that my solution to this assessment showcases the following:
- Using MVVM architecture.
- Building UI both with the interface builder, and programmatically.
- Utilising OOP principles to build easy-to-understand, scalable code.
- Executing UI-related code from outside of the ViewControllers by passing closures, as well as using the Delegate Pattern.
- Secure storage of important data that persists even after the app is deleted and re-installed using the Keychain.
- Efficient use of API calls, minimising the amount of API calls and the bandwidth of the responses.
- Using utility classes to provide important and reusable functionality.
- Writing comprehensive code documentation.
- Creating unit tests that use mock network services and mock keychain access to have reliable and predictable results.

Note: The API key provided in the Word document wasn't working, so I signed up with my own account. If the API key stops working and you get the error message "Cannot consume API", please let me know and I'll sign up with a new account and get the new API key to you ASAP!

I had a wonderful time doing this assessment and I look forward to hearing back from you all!

If you have any further questions, please let me know. Thanks!
